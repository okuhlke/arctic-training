# Reformat Data for Plotting 

Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Division of Commercial Fisheries. 2017. Daily salmon escapement counts from the OceanAK database, Alaska, 1921-2017. Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity. doi:10.5063/F1S46Q6M.


```{r}
esc <- read.csv("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/urn%3Auuid%3Af119a05b-bbe7-4aea-93c6-85434dcb1c5e", stringsAsFactors = F)
```


#Reformat Data for Plotting 

*Calculate annual escapement by species and region 
  + separate 
  + group by 
  + summarize 
*Filter for just Pacific Salmon (Sockeye, Chinook, Coho, Pink, Chum)
  +filter 
  
```{r}
annual_esc <- esc %>% 
  separate(sampleDate, into = c("year", "month", "Day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  group_by(year, Species, SASAP.Region) %>% 
  summarize(count = sum(DailyCount)) %>% 
  filter(Species %in% c("Chinook", "Sockeye", "Chum", "Coho", "Pink")) 

```

#genrate plots

```{r}
ggplot(annual_esc, mapping = aes(x = Species, y = count)) +
  geom_col(fill = "blue")
```

```{r}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
